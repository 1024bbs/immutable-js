TODO list:

  * Remove Range and Stack. They complicate things and are generally less useful.
    * Though Range makes for a good demo for lazy iterators.
  * toString
  * hashfn for collections
  * fromJS() should take a second options bag to describe how to do the conversion.
  * Convenience fn for lazy iterators from JS objects.
  * Abandon typescript in favor of being able to write denser JS.
  * Maintain and improve the .d.ts files. e.g. Documentation.
  * OrderedLazyIterator needs to know about Key types.
    * IndexedLazyIterator should be a subclass?
    * LazyIterator might just go away?
  * add "OrderedMap"
  * Finish test coverage
  * Performance testing! Preferably in node!
  * README
  * Play with ES6 specific features like iterator and proxy objects.
