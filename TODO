TODO list:

  * Remove Range and Stack. They complicate things and are generally less useful.
  * Consider adding "OrderedMap"
  * fromJS() should take a second options bag to describe how to do the conversion.
  * Finish test coverage
  * Abandon typescript in favor of being able to write denser JS.
  * Maintain and improve the .d.ts files. e.g. Documentation.
  * Convenience fn for lazy iterators from JS objects.
  * Consider OrderedMap and Set.
  * Performance testing! Preferably in node!
  * README
  * Deep equality
  * toString
  * add some of the ordered lazy fn to object.
  * use ordered for lazy object? It's not numeric, but it IS ordered.
    * reversed indices makes less sense there.

  * Play with ES6 specific features like iterator and proxy objects.
