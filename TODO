TODO list:

  * hash() for collections
  * fromJS() should take a second options bag to describe how to do the conversion.
  * Maintain and improve the .d.ts files. e.g. Documentation.
  * Generate HTML documentation from the .d.ts.
  * Consider combining the .d.ts into one big File.
  * Decide the fate of IMap and IList
  * Test including this as an npm dependency and ensure typescript resolution happens.
    * Can the .d.ts live at the top level?
    * Consider building a single file for "dist" instead of the ignored "build".
  * add "OrderedMap"
  * improve "slice" on Vector
  * Finish test coverage
  * Performance testing! Preferably in node!
  * README
  * Play with ES6 specific features like iterator and proxy objects.
  * Measure in comparison to mori: byteweight (compressed and zipped), performance.
